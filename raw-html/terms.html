              <p>Here’s what we do at Live Football Tickets:</p>
              <p>
                We have created an online marketplace to make hard-to-get
                tickets available to anyone providing quality customer service.
                Ticket prices on our site are determined by supply and demand
                (market value) by ticket specialists (the sellers). Since supply
                and demand are what drive the prices, today the prices can be
                low and tomorrow they may be higher, it can always change.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fans need to place orders with LiveFootballTickets not only
                because we have a friendly customer service, leading security
                and a money back guarantee – they also come to us since
                it&#x27;s so difficult to get tickets from the primary sources –
                especially for the biggest matches. So this is why those
                hard-to-get tickets are listed by the sellers above face value.
                Keep an eye out for deals though – sellers also provide tickets
                below face value when the market is full of tickets.
              </p>

                section is to let you know what you&#x27;re agreeing to when you
                place an order with us.

                Refunds are only possible when an event is cancelled and not
                postponed or rescheduled. Under the extraordinarily rare
                circumstances in which an event is cancelled or government
                restrictions on stadium capacities are implemented,
                LiveFootballTickets.com will refund everything except for the
                service fee (variable processing &amp; administrative expenses).
                A credit, in the form of a voucher code, for the full value of
                the service fee, will be provided to customers for application
                towards future orders, valid for 2 years. The value of the
                refund is for the price of tickets and shipping only, as
                LiveFootballtickets.com has the right to retain its booking fee
                to cover variable processing and administrative expenses, under
                Consumer Law. If an event has been cancelled and not
                rescheduled, you will be contacted by our customer service to
                arrange your refund.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the rare event a customer does not receive their tickets in
                time for a match (for an event that is not cancelled), a full
                refund will be issued to the buyer.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the customer would like to sell the tickets that they
                purchased, they can contact us to do so. We will attempt to sell
                the tickets for them on consignment – meaning that if we can
                resell them – then they get their money back – but if we can’t
                we will return the tickets to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the customer originally purchased those tickets from our
                website and we are able to sell their tickets, our fees for
                selling their tickets will be waived and they will receive 100%
                of the amount that we sell them for, up to the amount that they
                paid for them. Since consignment tickets are their property, we
                need the customer&#x27;s direction on the price they want for
                their tickets. Also, in case their tickets don&#x27;t sell, they
                must clearly tell us when they want the tickets returned to
                them.

                the venue or local media regularly for the correct time and date
                – yes, sometimes they will move the date of the matches. When
                you make a purchase for a specific event, you are purchasing
                tickets for that event regardless of the date/time that it is

              <p>
                Deliveries depend on the format of the ticket. These can either
                be regular physical tickets or in most cases, tickets tend to be
                released by the clubs in an electronic configuration. The most
                common ticket formats nowadays are either PDF files or Mobile
                Tickets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deliveries are usually made via Royal Mail or FedEx
                International and all deliveries will require a signature,
                however in some circumstances the seller may require you to meet
                a representative at or close to the venue on the day of the
                match. We send you an email to let you know when your tickets
                are shipped and you can expect them to arrive within 48 hours
                (usually 1 day) if sent by Royal Mail, and 7-10 days with FedEx
                International Delivery.

              <p>
                Because football tickets are typically printed and released by
                the teams very close to the time of the match (often just 3 days
                before or on the day of the match), international delivery may
                not be possible and your tickets will have to be delivered
                locally (to your home or your hotel the day/night before the
                event). Please notify the hotel reception desk/concierge so they
                are expecting to accept the delivery on your behalf. It is your
                responsibility to be available to accept the delivery. You also
                agree to provide us with a secure delivery location and
                authorise anybody at that address to act on your behalf to
                accept delivery of the package. This is absolutely required in
                order for us to manage the logistics of delivery for so many
                fans in so many different cities.
